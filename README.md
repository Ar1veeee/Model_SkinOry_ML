## About
This repository contains the machine learning model, dataset, and algorithm for classifying skin types based on provided input features or images. The model aims to recommend skin care products based on skin type classification.

## Skin Type Classifier

The [Skin Type Classifier](isi link ipynb model) was developed using the ResNet50 architecture as the base model for transfer learning that is taken from [Keras](https://keras.io/api/applications/). The dataset used is the `SkinTypeDataset` which contains labeled images categorized by skin types (e.g., Dry, Normal, and Oily).
